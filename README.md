Information
---------------
This app is an experimentation with Google's MLkit to apply a "filter" to a picture of a person's face. This app takes a 
picture via a camera intent and gets contour and landmark information of the face in question. The contour and landmark 
information is then used to apply very simple filters to the picture.
